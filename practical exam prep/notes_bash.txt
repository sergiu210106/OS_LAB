mkdir
cd
touch
ls
cp file1 file2 -> copies file1 to file2
mv file subdir/ -> moves file in subdir
ls -l /nonexistant 2> error.txt -> redirects the error output to error.txt
ls | wc -l -> pipes the output of ls to wc -l to count the number of lines (corresponding
to the number of files/directories)

variables are treated as strings implicitly, you need $(()) for explicit integer evaluation

1. Anchors in Regular Expressions

What they do: Anchors are special characters in regular expressions that don't match actual characters but rather positions within a string or line of text. They "anchor" the match to a specific location.

The specific anchors:
    ^ (Caret): Matches the beginning of a line. So, ^abc will only match lines that start with "abc".
    $ (Dollar sign): Matches the end of a line. xyz$ will only match lines that end with "xyz".
    \< : Matches the beginning of a word. \<the will match "the" or "theatre" but not "breathe".
    \> : Matches the end of a word. end\> will match "end" or "backend" but not "endure".

// grep examples 
grep "^a.*e$" words.txt
    ^a -> lines starting with A
    .* -> matches any characters
    e$ -> lines ending with e

grep -i '\(.\*\[aeiouAEIOU].\*\)\{3\}' words.txt
    -i ignores case
    [aeiouAEIOU] matches any vowel
    (.\*\[aeiouAEIOU].\*\) -> matches <zero or more characters> <any vowel> <zero or more characters>
    \{3\} matches the pattern 3 times

[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9._]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}

[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4} or \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}

{} -> number of repetitions

[^abc] -> matches every character except the ones in the brackets

grep -ic "word" filename.txt
    -c counts lines
    -i ignores case

sed 's/old/new/g' filename.txt

awk -F',' '{print $1, $3}' filename.csv
    -F',' sets the field separator to comma 
    the first and third fields are printed
