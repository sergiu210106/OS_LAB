# Operating Systems Lab

This repository contains solutions and code developed during university Operating Systems lab sessions. The labs covered a range of foundational OS concepts and involved both **Bash scripting** and **C programming**, focusing on essential system-level programming skills.

## Contents

### üñ•Ô∏è Bash Problems
A collection of shell scripting tasks designed to strengthen skills in:

- File and directory manipulation
- Conditional execution and loops
- Permissions and user management
- Text processing (using `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, etc.)
- Automation of routine tasks

### ‚öôÔ∏è C Programming Problems
These problems involve interacting directly with OS-level features in C, including:

#### üìÅ File Handling
- Reading from and writing to files using system calls (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`)
- File descriptor manipulation
- Working with file metadata using `stat` and related functions

#### üîó Pipes
- Creating and using unnamed pipes (`pipe()`)
- Parent-child communication through pipes
- Redirecting standard input/output

#### üßµ Threads
- Creating and managing threads using `pthread` library
- Synchronization with mutexes and condition variables
- Avoiding race conditions

#### üë• Processes
- Creating processes using `fork()`
- Executing programs with `exec` family
- Process synchronization using `wait`, `waitpid`
- Handling signals


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/os-lab.git
   cd os-lab```
2. Browse to the relevant directory (e.g., bash/, c/pipes/) to find problem-specific source files.

Compile C files using gcc. For example:
    ```bash
    gcc pipes/example.c -o example
    ./example

    ```

Requirements
GCC (for compiling C programs)

Bash (for running shell scripts)

POSIX-compliant OS (Linux recommended)
